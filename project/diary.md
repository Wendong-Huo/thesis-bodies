# What did you do today?

## 2020-12-30
create the project
run exp_000_stackframe

## 2020-12-31
analyze exp_000_stackframe results, which is good in walker2d

run exp_001, more repetitions with diff seeds, so we can make sure exp_000 is good.

run exp_002, train on multi-body, test on the same set of bodies, can stack frame help?
