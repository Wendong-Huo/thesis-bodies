# What is tested?

exp_023_pns the Treatment has a bad start, I guess it is because the random initialized sensor/motor pns module is worse than the arbitrary aligned one.

So to be fair, change initialization of pns modules into identity matrix.

# What are Treatment and Control groups?



# What are the results? (in short)


# Other Thoughts?

How can we accelerate the change in pns modules?
