# What is tested?

Now we relax the constraints: we allow a body come with a PNS system (one square linear layer with weights and bias).

Step 1. Train on 399. without any constraints on PNS.
Step 2. Train on 499, with CNS fixed.
Step 3. Train on 599, with CNS fixed.
Step 4. Train on 699, with CNS fixed.
Now we will have a policy that can work on V4.


# What are Treatment and Control groups?


# What are the results? (in short)

channel size of 32,32 is better than smaller such as 8,8 or 4,4
