# What is tested?

Does PNS help finding good alignment solutions?

1. Use 1xx, the random bodies, and Vanilla4, separately. (The folder name is problematic... )
2. Use pns and pns_init. start with identity matrix.
3. Once discover permutation change, align to new permutation.
4. At the end of training, we will have a permutation that might better than random.
