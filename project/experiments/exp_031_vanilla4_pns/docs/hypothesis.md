# What is tested?

Does PNS help finding good alignment solutions?

1. Use 1xx, random bodies. (The folder name is problematic... let leave it this way for now.)
2. Use pns and pns_init. start with identity matrix.
3. Once discover permutation change, align to new permutation.
4. At the end of training, we will have a permutation that might better than random.
