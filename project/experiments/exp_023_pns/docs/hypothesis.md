# What is tested?

No hypo here. Try out Asyc Steady State GA that supports Slurm.

Not ready, try exp_023_pns first, more promising.

# What are Treatment and Control groups?


# What are the results? (in short)

TODO for tomorrow:
1. env number from 8 to 16, cut the geno when needed
2. keep a running average for each geno [mean, count]. `new mean = (mean * count + new value) / (count + 1)`
3. stop condition
4. test on VACC
