# What is tested?

Generate two sets of bodies, one is original, the other is fatter.

train them to see if there is any difference in body thickness.

Can we create a body dataset,
containing 25 Walker2D (300s) variations, 25 HalfCheetah (400s) variations, 25 Ant (500s) variations, 25 Hopper (600s) variations,
100 bodies in total.

All the bodies can be quickly trained using PPO.

# What are the results? (in short)
