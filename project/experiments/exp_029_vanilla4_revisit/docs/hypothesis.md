# What is tested?

40 alignments, 5 runs for each alignment, search for difference in vanilla4 (Walker2D, HalfCheetah, Ant, Hopper).

Including one candidate from exp_019.



# What are Treatment and Control groups?

refer to `28.0.1.start_exp.sh`

# What are the results? (in short)

The best and the worst has no difference. The variance of each run is too large, and it takes too long to do one run, so it is very unlikely to find a solution that is not on the plateau!
