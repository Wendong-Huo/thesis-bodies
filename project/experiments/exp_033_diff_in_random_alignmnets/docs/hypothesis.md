# What is tested?

Previously we showed that for manually constructed morphology, alignment matters, and there is gradient around the peak.

However, in the case that the good solution is not obvious, it is hard to find a peak.

So we are testing if there is gradient in general.


# What are Treatment and Control groups?

Two arbitrary alignments.


# What are the results? (in short)


# Other Thoughts?
